# RPC (Draft)

The bridge subscribes the client to an RPC back-channel on connect:

	/clients/{client_id}/rpc/+/result

The back-channel subscription is managed by the bridge.
Clients are not allowed to subscribe to any client's back-channel manually
(including their own channel).

## API browsing / discovery

* The Client can get all available RPC APIs by subscribing to ```/rpc/+/api```
* Every RPC service publishes its API to ```/rpc/{service_id}/api```
	
TODO Define API format

## CALL / RESULT

* The client subscribes to ```/clients/{client_id}/rpc/+/result``` to get results from RPC services
* The client publishes an RPC call to ```/clients/{client_id}/rpc/{service_id}```
* The service responds to the RPC call at ```/clients/{client_id}/rpc/{service_id}/result```
